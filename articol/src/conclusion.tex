The paper presented an innovative mobile gateway platform for wireless sensor networks
that offers the ability to interface sensor networks in a novel way.

The platform is easy-to-use and customize to meet the different needs of applications. The system is able to collect data from a Wireless Sensor Network island and offers a potential drone operator realtime data concerning nodes in proximity. The system uses the Parrot AR drone and is decoupled from the piloting module, allowing different piloting schemes to be used with it (i.e. the drone can be piloted anywhere, with or without an operator and it will collect data automatically).
