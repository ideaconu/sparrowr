Wireless sensor network applications are on rise, largely thanks to the the internet of things, but developing the correct hardware for an application is not very easy, mainly due to the size of the nodes, that tends to be usually very small. This

In this paper, we will present a brand new powerful and yet low power platform that can be used to easily develop a new application of a wireless sensor network. We designed it as a development platform that lets the user to focus on what he would like to do with the platform and not how to do it.

This platform comes in a very small package, can be programmed using Arduino Studio and has a daughter board extension in order to be fully compatible with all Arduino hardware.

order to collect the data, gateway platforms \cite{steenkamp2009wireless} are
