Wireless sensor network applications are on rise, largely thanks to the Internet of Things, but
developing the correct hardware for an application is not very easy, mainly due to the size of the
nodes, that tends to be usually very small. This is combined with the fact that some sensors
require a specific voltage to run which can lead to the use of a level shifter and potentially
compatibility problems with exiting sensors. Also the software can be difficult to write and can
require specific operating system thanks to the tools needed to compile the code.

In this paper, we will present a brand new powerful and yet low power platform that can be used to easily develop a new application of a wireless sensor network. We designed it as a development platform that lets the user to focus on what he would like to do with the platform and not how to do it.

This platform comes in a very small package, can be programmed using Arduino Studio and has a daughter board extension in order to be fully compatible with all Arduino hardware.
