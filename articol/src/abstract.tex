Mobile Gateway for Wireless Sensor Networks utilizing drones

Wireless Sensor Networks have good uses in applications running in remote
locations, where maintenance is difficult. Wireless sensor network islands often
need a connection with a gateway in order to communicate with the outside world,
but this cannot be provided in all circumstances. A different approach to
connecting wireless sensor networks is to use mobile gateways that can reach
the remote locations where sensor devices are running. Our design includes a gateway
mounted on an unmanned aircraft that collects data on its flight path.
