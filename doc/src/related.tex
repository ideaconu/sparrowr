% Truism
ALgorithms for eh exists, but they are tested only by simulating the results. Even though the
simulation is succesful, without real world testing, no real conclusion can be taken. There are
different factors that can influence the outcome of the algorithm, such as current leakage of the
capactitor, the fact that in time, the capacitance will be reduced or that the leakage will
increase ...
